#### Data
Represents the data-layer of the application. The `Data` module, which is a part of the outermost layer, is responsible for data retrieval. This can be in the form of API calls to a server, a local database, or even both. 

##### Contents of Data
* **Repositories**
  * Every `Repository` **should** implement `Repository` from the **Domain** layer.
  * Using `polymorphism`, these repositories from the data layer can be passed across the boundaries of layers, starting from the `View` down to the `Usecases` through the `Controller` and `Presenter`.
  * Retrieve data from databases or other methods. 
  * Responsible for any API calls and high-level data manipulation such as
    * Registering a user with a database
    * Uploading data
    * Downloading data
    * Handling local storage
    * Calling an API
* **Models** (not a must depending on the application)
  * Extensions of `Entities` with the addition of extra members that might be platform-dependent. For example, in the case of local databases, this can be manifested as an `isDeleted` or an `isDirty` entry in the local database. Such entries cannot be present in the `Entities` as that would violate the **Dependency Rule** since **Domain** should not be aware of the implementation.
  * In the case of our application, models in the `Data` layer will not be necessary as we do not have a local database. Therefore, it is unlikely that we will need extra entries in the `Entities` that are platform-dependent.
* **Mappers**
  * Map `Entity` objects to `Models` and vice-versa.
  * Static classes with static methods that receive either an `Entity` or a `Model` and return the other.
  * Only necessary in the presence of `Models`
* Extra
  * `Utility` classes if needed
  * `Constants` classes if needed
